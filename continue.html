		<h2>The Legend of Korra (2012)</h2>
			<p>The Legend of Korra is a sequel series to Avatar: The Last Airbender. It consists of 4 seasons with around 13 episodes each. The series is set 70 years later in the same world as Avatar: The Last Airbender. Unlike Aang, Korra has no trouble mastering the elements. Instead, she and her friends are faced with challenges with the Spirit World and its connection to reality.</p>

		<h2>The Last Airbender (2010)</h2>
		<h4>Live Action Movie</h4>
		<p>The movie begins in a similar way to the animated series, as Katara and Sokka discover Aang in an iceberg, and Zuko seeks to pursue them. However, it differs quite a bit. In the movie, Aang only masters waterbending, and a 'dragon spirit,' which wasn't present in the series, plays a large role in the story. The movie ends after Aang defeats General Zhao during the Northern Water Tribe invasion, as Firelord Ozai tasks Azula with preventing Aang from mastering the remaining elements.</p>

		<h2>Avatar: the Last Airbender (2024)</h2>
		<h4>Live Action Series</h4>
		<p>The live action series came out very recently, and is still ongoing. While the first season of this series resembles the first season of the animated series, there are many differences, which will change the course of the story. For example, in the live action series, Aang doesn't master waterbending, Jet, King Bumi, and the earthbenders from the Northern Air Temple all appear within the same episode, and Sozin's Comet, which plays a large role in the animated series, is yet to be of importance.</p>
